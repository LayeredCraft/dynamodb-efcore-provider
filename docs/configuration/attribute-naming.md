# Attribute Naming

_By default the provider applies CamelCase to property names in the model when resolving DynamoDB
attribute names.
You can switch to a different built-in convention, supply a custom naming function, or pin
individual properties to an explicit attribute name._

## Default Naming Convention

The provider applies **CamelCase** to every declared property that has no explicit attribute name
configured. This happens automatically at model finalization — you do not need to call anything to
get it.

| CLR property name | DynamoDB attribute name (default) |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `CustomerId`      | `customerId`                      |
| `OrderDate`       | `orderDate`                       |
| `ShippingAddress` | `shippingAddress`                 |

This means the attribute names stored in DynamoDB will differ from the CLR property names unless
you override the convention.

!!! note "Key attributes follow the same convention"

    The naming convention applies to partition key and sort key properties as well. Your DynamoDB
    table's key schema must use the convention-transformed name. For example, a `CustomerId`
    property with the default CamelCase convention maps to DynamoDB attribute `"customerId"` — the
    table must define `"customerId"` as its hash key, not `"CustomerId"`.

## Built-in Conventions

Switch to a different convention for an entity type using `HasAttributeNamingConvention`:

```csharp
modelBuilder.Entity<Order>(b =>
{
    b.ToTable("Orders");
    b.HasPartitionKey(x => x.CustomerId);
    b.HasAttributeNamingConvention(DynamoAttributeNamingConvention.SnakeCase);
});
```

Available values:

| Convention                | CLR name → DynamoDB attribute                  |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `CamelCase` **(default)** | `OrderDate` → `orderDate`                      |
| `None`                    | `OrderDate` → `OrderDate` (CLR name unchanged) |
| `SnakeCase`               | `OrderDate` → `order_date`                     |
| `KebabCase`               | `OrderDate` → `order-date`                     |
| `UpperSnakeCase`          | `OrderDate` → `ORDER_DATE`                     |

Built-in conventions use Humanizer-style word splitting, so acronyms map naturally (for example,
`URLValue` → `url_value`, `PK` → `pk`).

Use `None` to opt out of all automatic transformation and keep CLR names as-is:

```csharp
b.HasAttributeNamingConvention(DynamoAttributeNamingConvention.None);
```

## Custom Naming Function

Pass a `Func<string, string>` delegate for transformations not covered by the built-in options:

```csharp
b.HasAttributeNamingConvention(name => name.ToUpperInvariant());
```

The delegate receives the model property name (including user-defined shadow properties) and
returns the DynamoDB attribute name. It is called once per declared property during model
finalization.

!!! note "Scope of convention-based renaming"

    Convention-based renaming applies to EF model members (entity properties, key properties, and
    owned-type containing/member attributes). It does not rewrite ad-hoc nested map keys provided
    as runtime data values (for example, dictionary entry keys).

## Per-Property Override

`HasAttributeName` on a property always wins over any convention — entity-level or default:

```csharp
modelBuilder.Entity<Order>(b =>
{
    b.ToTable("Orders");
    b.HasPartitionKey(x => x.CustomerId);
    b.HasAttributeNamingConvention(DynamoAttributeNamingConvention.SnakeCase);

    // Stored as "PK" even though SnakeCase would produce "customer_id"
    b.Property(x => x.CustomerId).HasAttributeName("PK");
    b.Property(x => x.OrderId).HasAttributeName("SK");
});
```

This is the recommended pattern when your DynamoDB table uses short, generic key names (`PK`,
`SK`) but your CLR model uses descriptive property names.

## Owned Types

Owned entity types inherit the naming convention from their root entity. If the root uses
SnakeCase, all owned declared properties also use SnakeCase unless explicitly overridden on the
owned type:

```csharp
modelBuilder.Entity<Order>(b =>
{
    b.ToTable("Orders");
    b.HasPartitionKey(x => x.CustomerId);
    b.HasAttributeNamingConvention(DynamoAttributeNamingConvention.SnakeCase);

    b.OwnsOne(x => x.ShippingAddress, ab =>
    {
        // Override for this owned type only — its properties use CamelCase
        ab.HasAttributeNamingConvention(DynamoAttributeNamingConvention.CamelCase);
    });
});
```

The **containing attribute name** — the DynamoDB map key that holds the owned object (for example
`"shippingAddress"`) — is also transformed by the inherited convention. Override it with
`HasAttributeName` on the owned navigation builder:

```csharp
b.OwnsOne(x => x.ShippingAddress, ab =>
{
    ab.HasAttributeName("shipping_address"); // explicit map key name
});
```

## Precedence

When multiple sources could apply a name to the same property, the provider resolves them in this
order (highest to lowest):

1. Explicit `HasAttributeName(...)` on the property
1. Entity-level `HasAttributeNamingConvention(...)` set directly on the entity type
1. Convention inherited from the root entity (for owned types without their own setting)
1. Provider default: **CamelCase**
